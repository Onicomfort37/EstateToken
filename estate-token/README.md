# Real Estate Investment Tokenization Protocol

A comprehensive Clarity smart contract for fractional real estate investment on the Stacks blockchain, enabling investors to purchase tokenized shares of real estate properties and receive proportional rental income distributions.

## üè¢ Overview

This protocol allows for the tokenization of real estate properties, enabling fractional ownership through fungible tokens. Investors can purchase property tokens representing ownership shares and receive rental income distributions proportional to their holdings.

### Key Features

- **Fractional Ownership**: Properties are divided into tokens representing ownership shares
- **Rental Income Distribution**: Automated distribution of rental income to token holders
- **Property Management**: Comprehensive property lifecycle management
- **Secondary Markets**: Support for token trading between investors
- **Transparent Financials**: Real-time tracking of property performance and income
- **Multi-Property Support**: Single contract managing multiple properties

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Property Management**: Creation, funding, and lifecycle management of properties
2. **Investment System**: Token-based investment with STX transfers
3. **Income Distribution**: Rental income collection and dividend distribution
4. **Financial Tracking**: Comprehensive property financials and performance metrics
5. **Secondary Market**: Token trading infrastructure

### Property Lifecycle

## üìà Financial Calculations

### Token Pricing
```
Price per Token = Total Property Value √∑ Total Tokens
```

### Ownership Percentage
```
Ownership % = (Tokens Owned √∑ Total Tokens) √ó 100
```

### Dividend Calculation
```
Dividend = Tokens Owned √ó Income per Token
Income per Token = Total Distributable Income √∑ Tokens in Circulation
```

### Fee Calculations
```
Platform Fee = Investment Amount √ó Platform Fee Rate √∑ 10,000
Management Fee = Rental Income √ó Management Fee Rate √∑ 10,000
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain testnet/mainnet access
- Clarity CLI or development environment
- STX tokens for testing/deployment

### Deployment
1. Deploy the smart contract to Stacks blockchain
2. Initialize contract with desired fee rates
3. Create first property for testing
4. Set up property management permissions

### Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

Tests cover:
- Property creation and validation
- Investment logic and calculations
- Income distribution mechanisms
- Fee calculations
- Edge cases and error handling
